<h2>What is Tsuika?</h2>
<card-p type="quote">
    “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” — Leonardo da Vinci.
</card-p>
<p>
    Tsuika is a web component and classless CSS framework that enables developers to create HTML websites quickly and easily. This project was originally intented to create only webcomponents however the growth of new.css had inspired many and enabled development of Tsuika to be something more than just a web component library. Tsuika aims to go above and beyond standard classless CSS frameworks by utilizing the power of web components.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The name "Tsuika" also derives from the Japanese word "追加" which means to add. Tsuika aims to add a set of original and powerful styles and web components on top of your standard HTML.

    <h3>Demonstration</h3>
    <p>So what do you mean by "powered by web components?". Well its easier to understand by looking under the hood. The quote label you just saw for instance was made with a single component. (so is the code block component below as well!)</p>
    <code-block
        theme="nord"
        lang="javascript"
        code="
        &#60;card-p type='quote'&#62;
            “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” — Leonardo da Vinci.
        &#60;/card-p&#62;
        "

    </code-block>
