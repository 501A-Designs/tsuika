<a name="sol"></a>

### üìÉ Styled Ordered Lists:

Adding the `id` with the names below will enable you to add styles to the number of your ordered list (Ordered list are use numerical values).

| Id Name      | List Style                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| ol-round     | Adds a circle around the number        |
| ol-capsule   | Adds a capsule shape around the number |
| ol-rectangle | Adds a rectangle around the number     |
| ol-square    | Adds a square around the number        |

_Add the id's to the `ol` tag_

You can also additionally style the color of the numbers and background by adding the `::before` pseudo class to your `id`'s `li` tag.

Example:
`ol-round li::before`

<a name="sg"></a>

### üî≥ Simple Grid:

You can use CSS grid by simply adding `grid-1fr-1fr-1fr...` as a class to a component. However, this grid can only support up to 6 columns at max (`grid-1fr-1fr-1fr-1fr-1fr-1fr`). Note: If you add the `section` tag as a child component of the Simple Grid class, it will be formatted into a Content Card (Grid Content Card). You can also use the `grid-auto` class, which will create a grid that is automatically laid out depending on the number of components you have.

<a name="sfb"></a>

### üîõ Simple Flex Box:

You can create a CSS flex box by adding the following class names to any parent component. All flex properties have a flex-direction of `row`. Variations include the following:

| Class Name    | Flex Property            |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| flex-standard | No Assigned Property     |
| flex-right    | justify-content: right;  |
| flex-center   | justify-content: center; |
| flex-left     | justify-content: left;   |

<a name="hvr"></a>

### ‚òù Hover:

Hover is initiated using the `:hover` pseudo element. Writing the `hover-classname` as a class name enables the object an effect when hovered.

| Class Name     | Effect on hover          |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| hover-rotation | Rotates in 3D            |
| hover-scale    | Scales                   |
| hover-opacity  | Lowers Opacity           |
| hover-blur     | Blurs                    |
| hover-arrow    | Adds an arrow at the end |

_Best works with Grid Content Card. `hover-arrow` works best with buttons_

<a name="load"></a>

### üîÉ Load:

The `load-effectname` class will be enabled when the webpage has loaded. This component is good for when you want to create page transitions, or when creating simple drawers with animations.

| Class Name | Effect on load                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| load-wave  | Shows content with a radiating circle |
| load-open  | Shows content from top to bottom      |
| load-drop  | Drops content one after another       |

_`wave` and `open` best work with the `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML tags._

v1.7 now supports the `load-animation` web component. You can change the color of the animating object using the `objColor` property.
